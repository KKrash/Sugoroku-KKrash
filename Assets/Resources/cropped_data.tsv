1	千人針	NA	NA	NA	Thousand Person Stitches	NA	NA	NA	A senninbari is a long white cloth with 1000 red stitches. Each stitch was stitched by a different woman, usually by wives and mothers, and were given to Japanese men that were going off to war.  	The senninbari originated from The First Sino-Japanese War where the senninbari was not a long piece of cloth but rather a handkerchief. Red thread was used most as it had a meaning of avoiding disasters, but later on other colors of thread were used. Men would commonly wear the senninbari around their waist and stomach area. In Japan, the stomach represents the area where one’s vitality and power resides, so wearing the senninbari around the stomach was especially significant. Many senninbaris were personalized with different images (such as the rising sun and tigers) and patriotic slogans. Some senninbaris also had coins stitched into it as it was believed that coins could provide more protection. Some also had pockets to hold good luck charms which were purchased from shrines and temples.   	Tigers were a popular motif and were stitched on senninbaris because they were believed to have the power to roam far from home and return safely, which is what people were hoping for on behalf of the soldiers. The phrase “a tiger travels a thousand miles and returns a thousand miles” (虎は千里を行き千里を帰る). Because of this, it was said that the stitches of women born in the year of the tiger would be more effective, especially if they sewed the number corresponding to their age.
2	出征	NA	NA	皆に「勝って來るぞ」の一節を唄って貰ふ	Off to War	NA	NA	Have everyone shout "come back victorious!"	Wartime media commonly depicted women enthusiastically sending off Japanese soldiers at a train station with food. Their departure for war, known as shussei on the home front, was supposed to be a reason for celebration rather than sorrow among soldiers and families alike. Families and friends, as a result, often glorified death as a demonstration of courage and loyalty to the state.  [## how much of this is propaganda? were families really "happy"##]	Japanese schoolchildren were condiitioned to learn new vocabulary related to the empire's preparation for war, including shussei, which translates as "departure to the front" or "going to war." Instilling reverence for the military into youth curricula was part of a broader celebration of the military in Japanese imperial culture. Future soldiers were told that they should not fear death, but rather channel their nationalist zeal for the empire into a heroic death for the emperor. This suguroku is part of that celebration of death in battle: see for example square 17   	The rhetoric of self sacrifice for the emperor was part of a modern reimagining of samurai culture, reinterpreted for propaganda purposes. Soldiers' diaries reflect the impact of this ideology. Even if soldiers questioned the ideology, they felt compelled to maintain the appearance selfless devotion to the emperor.   
3	挙国一致	NA	NA	皆手を三度たゝく	National Unity	NA	NA	Everyone clap three times	As Prime Minister of Japan, Konoe Fumimaro directed the expansion of the so-called "China Incident" into a full-scale invasion of China. During his first term as Prime Minister from 1937 to 1939, he supported and carried out policies that led to Japan's aggressive expansion into China. Konoe saw the invasion of China as a means of fortifying Japan's economy and military, as well as solidifying its position as a leading world power. He believed that by establishing a presence in China, Japan could secure the resources and markets required for its long-term economic growth, as well as counteract the growing power of Western nations in the region	Konoe Fumimaro's efforts to reduce tensions with the Western powers involved a combination of diplomatic negotiations and policy changes. In 1938, he proposed a peace initiative known as the "Konoe Plan" which aimed to settle the ongoing conflicts in Asia and improve relations with the Western powers. [##obviously didn't work -- what happened##] The plan involved a series of negotiations with the Western powers, including the United States, in an effort to resolve the growing tensions between Japan and the West. Additionally, Konoe implemented a series of domestic policies aimed at moderating Japan's foreign policy and avoiding conflict with the West. He sought to reduce military spending [##again didn't work!!##] and improve relations with the Soviet Union, where in the latter effort, his government signed the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact. He also established a cabinet-level organization, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, to coordinate government policies and promote a more moderate and stable foreign policy.	NA

The incident involved Chinese troops, who were part of the East Hebei Autonomous Government, turning against their Japanese advisors and collaborators in the city of Tongzhou, near Beijing.	The Tongzhou Incident took place on July 29, 1937, during the Second Sino-Japanese War and marked a turning point in the conflict. Chinese troops who were part of the East Hebei Autonomous Government, a puppet government established by Japan, mutinied against their Japanese advisors and collaborators in Tongzhou, a strategically important city near Beijing. The mutiny resulted in the deaths of several hundred Japanese and Chinese collaborators. The incident had significant consequences, as it fueled anti-Japanese sentiment in China and led to a further escalation of hostilities between China and Japan.	The mutiny was sparked by growing resentment and frustration among the Chinese soldiers, who felt they were being mistreated and exploited by their Japanese superiors. The uprising began in the early hours of the morning and quickly escalated, with the mutineers killing several hundred Japanese soldiers, Chinese collaborators, and their families. The violence continued for several days, with Chinese troops eventually regaining control of the city.  The Tongzhou Incident had far-reaching consequences for the course of the Second Sino-Japanese War. It fueled anti-Japanese sentiment among the Chinese population, with many seeing the mutiny as a symbol of Chinese resistance against Japanese aggression. The incident also led to a further escalation of hostilities between China and Japan, as the Japanese military sought to retaliate for the loss of life and humiliation suffered during the mutiny. Ultimately, the Tongzhou Incident played a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the conflict between China and Japan during this period.

The Battle of Beiping - Tianjin (平津作战) was part of the second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 - 1945. The battle took place in both Tianjin and Beijing on July 25th to 31st, 1937 after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and was first started by the Langfang Incident (廊坊) on July 25th, 1937, where Japanese reinforcements fought Chinese troops at Langfang, a city on the railroad between Beijing and Tianjin. On July 29th, Japanese naval forces attacked Tianjin and the port of Tanggu (塘沽) and on July 30th Chinese troops were ordered to retreat and abandon the city to the Japanese, which resulted in the fall of Tianjin. As Chinese forces withdrew to the south after the fall of Tianjin, Beijing was isolated and was captured by the Japanese without further resistance on 8 August 1937, and led to the fall of Beijing. General Masakazu Kawabe entered the city on 18 August in a military parade, and posted proclamations at important points announcing that he was the new military governor of the city.	At 8 am on July 29, the 11th Independent Mixed Brigade of the Kwantung Army attacked Chinese positions near Huangsi and Beiyuan. The Hebei Peace Preservation Corps defending Huangsi withdrew at 6 pm. The 39th Independent Brigade defending Beiyuan was disarmed by the Japanese two days later. Beiping soon fell to the Japanese. General Masakazu Kawabe, commander of the CGA Brigade, entered the city on August 8 in a military parade in which the citizens of Beiping were forced to celebrate.  At dawn on July 29, the IJA 5th Division and Japanese marines attacked Tianjin and the port of Tanggu, defended by Chinese units of the 38th Division. The Chinese soldiers and many local volunteers fought gallantly. They even managed to capture the Tianjin Station from the Japanese. The 38th Division mounted a series of counterattacks on the Japanese headquarters at Haiguangsi and the Dongjuzi airport. However, the Japanese were able to repulse the Chinese counterattacks with artillery and air support. After heavy fighting, Tianjin fell to the Japanese on July 30. On July 31, the 27th Independent Brigade managed to break out of Beiping to Chahar and returned to the NRA 143rd Division. That same day, Japanese forces finally conquered the entirety of Beiping-Tianjin by capturing the last Chinese positions near Dahuichang.  The Battle of Beiping-Tianjin had ended, but a full-scale war had now erupted between China and Japan.  ## add something about unresolved issues between Japan and PRC -- has Japan "apologized" 	NA

NA	Conduct your long-range mission and advance to 17	On August 15, 1937, the Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service (IJNAF) commenced bomber raids on Nanking's Jurong Air Base. They faced stiff resistance from the Chinese Air Force, suffering significant losses.	That resistance was in large part due to an air raid warning system established with the help of an American advisor to the Chinese Air Force named Claire Lee Chennault. Claire Lee Chennault was a retired Army Air Corps captain who supported the Kuomintang government in China during the Sino-Japanese War. He served as Chiang Kai-shek's air force advisor, leading the war against Japan. With the aid of the U.S. government he created an American Volunteer Air Corps famously known as the Flying Tigers. When World War II began, he returned to active duty as colonel and served with the U.S. in China.	NA

They saw extensive service in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific theatre of World War II. 	Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces: Before the late 1920s the IJN did not have a separate marine force, instead it used naval landing forces or rikusentai formed from individual ships's crews, who received infantry training as part of their basic training, for special and/or temporary missions. In the late 1920s the navy began to form Special Naval Landing Forces as standing regiments.  Infantry Units:  - Kure Naval Base  - Maizuru Naval Base  - Sasebo Naval Base  - Yokosuka Naval Base   Non-naval base SNLFs:  - Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force: Stationed in Shanghai by the Imperial Japanese Navy to protect its interests, it was the first official SNLF unit. They were established in Shanghai following the First Shanghai Incident in 1932. Since then, it has become the only permanent land combat unit in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The unit had an authorized strength of approximately 2000 men and was organized into a brigade made up of several battalions and smaller special weapons units.	NA

Izumo was the lead ship of her class of armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. The ship spent most of the 1920s as a training ship for naval cadets and became flagship of the IJN's China forces in 1932 during the First Shanghai Incident. Izumo participated in the Battle of Shanghai five years later and was not damaged, despite repeated aerial attacks.	Kiyoshi Hasegawa was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy and the 18th Governor-General of Taiwan during most of the Pacific War, serving from December 1940 to December 1944. In December 1936, Hasegawa was given command of a fleet, and was appointed commander of the Third Fleet on 20 October 1937. The Panay Incident took place during his tenure as fleet commander. As Commander-in-Chief of the Third Fleet in China, Hasegawa met several Chinese admirals and generals, who respected Hasegawa for his civil behavior. He was once again assigned to command the Yokosuka Naval District on 25 April 1938, and was promoted to full admiral on 1 December 1939.  Izumo was the lead ship of her class of armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself, the ship was built in Britain. She often served as a flagship and participated in most of the naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Izumo was ordered to protect Japanese citizens and interests in 1913 during the Mexican Revolution and was still there when World War I began in 1914. She was then tasked to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping off the western coasts of North and Central America. The ship assisted the armored cruiser Asama in early 1915 when she struck a rock off Baja California. In 1917, Izumo became the flagship of the Japanese squadron deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. After the war, she sailed to Great Britain to take control of some ex-German submarines and then escorted them part of the way back to Japan. The ship spent most of the 1920s as a training ship for naval cadets and became flagship of the IJN's China forces in 1932 during the First Shanghai Incident. Izumo participated in the Battle of Shanghai five years later and was not damaged, despite repeated aerial attacks. The ship played a minor role in the Pacific War, supporting Japanese forces during Philippines Campaign until she struck a mine. She returned to Japan in 1943 and again became a training ship for naval cadets. Izumo was sunk by American carrier aircraft during the attack on Kure in July 1945. Her wreck was salvaged and scrapped in 1947.  Timeline of Izumo: * September 25, 1900: Completion * August 14, 1904: Participated in the Battle of Ulsan * May 27-28, 1905: Participated in the naval battle of Tsushima Strait * September 1, 1921: Becomes cruiser of the first class * May 30, 1931: Became a coastal defense ship * July 7, 1937: Becomes Flagship of Third Fleet * 14 August 1937: Attacked by Chinese torpedo boats (repulsed with river gunboats) * July 24, 1945: Sunk by Allied U.S. forces on the Seto Inland Sea and Kure  	NA

A year later, Japan formally implemented its food ration system by donating most of its surplus goods to the military and selling the rest back to local corporations. As a result, civilians felt starvation before soldiers did, even though Japan was not yet part of the total war.	Japan, in need of rations for its military, diverted exports of rice from Korea and Taiwan to their own market, effectively starving these people. This created a vehicle through which the imperial government could promote assimilation by distributing food rations to citizens who participated in cultural practices, such as Shintōism. Furthermore, they stressed self-sufficiency among the colonies despite their own reliance on them to support the military. When Taiwanese and Korean markets suffered a bad harvest in 1939, Japan reoriented its attention to Southeast Asian markets for the remainder of WWII, completely redirecting their rice exports to the mainland. This reveals how the empire, despite having not yet joined the Axis Powers, fully intended to wage total war.	NA

NA	Rolls other than 1, 3, and 5 may not proceed	The Japanese naval blockade in August 1937 was a strategic move during the Second Sino-Japanese War, aimed at isolating and weakening the Chinese government. The blockade effectively cut off China's access to international trade, causing significant economic hardships for the Chinese.	During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese navy implemented a blockade in August 1937 to isolate and undermine the Chinese government. By cutting off China's access to international trade and resources, Japan aimed to weaken China's ability to resist its advances. The blockade had severe economic consequences for the Chinese, as it disrupted the flow of essential goods, such as food, fuel, and military supplies, leading to increased hardships for the Chinese population.	The blockade encompassed a wide area of the Chinese coast, stretching from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the southernmost tip of China. Japanese warships patrolled the waters, intercepting and detaining any foreign vessels attempting to enter Chinese ports. This effectively cut off China's access to vital resources, including food, fuel, and military supplies, which were critical for sustaining its war effort and supporting its population.  The economic impact of the blockade was profound, leading to widespread shortages and soaring inflation in China. The Chinese government struggled to maintain its war effort and provide for its people, which further undermined its ability to resist Japanese advances. The blockade also placed significant pressure on the international community to intervene in the conflict, as countries with economic interests in the region were directly affected by the disruption of trade. Ultimately, the Japanese naval blockade in August 1937 played a crucial role in shaping the course of the Second Sino-Japanese War and had far-reaching consequences for China and the global community.

At the time during the Asia-Pacific War, Japan's mass media industry mainly consisted of print media, film, and radio. As the war kept escalating, the government, due to national mobilization, took over most aspects of daily lives of Japanese civilians, including mass media. They imposed strict controls, censorship, and promoted national sacrifice. Their main message to the public through media was the declaration that Japan was a divine nation protected by the gods.  The government made use of the Newspaper Law to higly censor the radio network which forbid Freedom of Press, requiring government clearance to publish war related news. The law restricted media from publishing governmental documents and legislations, which led to leaving most of the Japanese people ignorant about the country's economic and military incidents.	NA

In this particular illustration, engineers can be seen holding up a fellow soldier as they cross a river. This was a tactic used by the Japanese to cross wide rivers where building a bridge was strategically not worth it.	The Japanese Engineer Corps were tasked with building and reparing bridges and roads for infantry and vehicle transport. The engineers were fitted with a variety of tools. The most common weres shovels and sledgehammers. Other regiments were given small rubber boats, piledrivers, and tractors. These engineers ensured that army divisions were well supported and could move swiftly to maximize their survival.	From “The Rising Sun” by John Toland:  “From the first the enemy had kept the British off balance in Malaya. Outnumbered more than 2 to 1, the Japanese never stopped to consolidate a gain, to regroup or wait for supplies; they surged down the main roads on thousands of bicycles and in hundreds of abandoned British cars and trucks. Whenever they came to a destroyed bridge, the cyclists waded across the river holding aloft their bikes or crossed on log bridges supported on the shoulders of engineers.”

Between 1879 and 1936, for example, the term appeared in only 64 stories in the the Asahi Shimbun daily newspaper. In 1937 it surged to 398 and in 1938 to 731, more than two stores per day. This suguroku was thus part of a broadly shift in print media.  	Why was there such an explosion of stories about the "home front"? The Konoe administration expanded the war in China in July 1937 without a clear plan for national mobilization. Without formal structures for a total war, the government needed voluntary efforts, and most media outlets celebrated those efforts as virtuous and patriotic.  Mikula, Maja.

It served as a strategic site for the Japanese army’s military campaigns during the second World War. The Japanese landings in Hangzhou Bay forced many civilians into refugees and foreshadowed the coming of the Nanjing Massacre.	Japan’s capture of Beiping and Tianjin in July 1937 and attack on Shanghai in August 1937 kick-started the invasion of China. In October 1937, the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEA), which was led by Gen. Matsui Iwane, was ordered to destroy enemy forces in and around Shanghai. Gen. Iwane was later joined with Gen. Yanagawa Heisuke who anticipated swift surrender from Chiang Kai-shek’s National Government. However, the Japanese military encountered Chinese resistance, leading to the estimated death of 9,185 and 31,125 wounded Japanese soldiers at Shanghai. With the Japanese landing at Hangzhou Bay, this resistance was snuffed out as the Japanese military successfully gained control of Shanghai. 	With the various Japanese military attacks during the second World War, many civilians became displaced. The repeated Japanese landings in Hangzhou Bay caused an estimate of around five million of the Zhejiangese population into refugee life. The Japanese landing in Hangzhou Bay in early November 1937 caused the residents a rude awakening to the reality of the war. Around 400,000 of the Zhejiang population fled in fear. Three years later, the Japanese launched a second round of large-scale armed attacks in the region. The goal was to take control of the greater part of northern Zhejiang that included Ningbo, a key seaport in the coastal area. This set in motion a fresh wave of refugees, reflecting the experiences of refugees from the Hangzhou Bay landing.

Newspaper stories began to describe the emperor as directly involved in state affairs, helping to plan the war, rather than just spiritually supportive of the troops and their families. Historians disagree on whether that change reflects a real change in the emperor's activities, or merely a shift in publicity and propaganda. This sugoroku from December 1938 is slighly behind that trend and still depcits the emperor as removed from wartime planning.  	NA

The Air Defense Law, enacted April 5, 1935, integrated air defense exercises under the air defense plan esablished by the district governor, and mobilized all local residents on this basis. Training to minimize damage in the event of an air raid was conceived as a part of a national mobilization plan. Air defense exercises accompanied by light control were carried out. 	On the local level, neighborhoods were organized into fire prevention groups of roughly 10 households. These exercises were ultimately futile in the face of real large-scale raids, such as the US firebombing campaigns, but they played a major role in incorporating the people into the wartime structure. Furthermore, in 1927, the Bureau of Resources was established in the cabinet as a mobilization planning agency. The Bureau of Resources was responsible for overseeing the establishment and execution of plans for the control and operation of human and material resources. The aim of the Bureau of Resources was to strengthen the national defense system. Active-duty military personnel in the Army and Navy served as administrative officers.	NA

The relief organization grew from another group that he founded in 1877 known as the Hakuaisha. With a new pool of educated women emerging from 1910s reform, it's likely that the Society was among many other employers who sought them out for nursing, clerical, and other forms of "feminine" work.	Originally a politician, Sano Tsunetami supported the Japanese government in the Satsuma Rebellion by utilizing his privileged education in Western Learning, which included Western medicine from the Dutch East India Company as well as military science, especially in Western-style ships and guns. He not only incorporated this knowledge to help found a naval base in the Saga domain, but to found the Hakuaisha for wounded soldier relief.	 To gain recruits, Japanese medical officer Ishiguro Tadanori would hold lectures that illustrated the Red Cross purpose: ‘The responsibility of the Red Cross is to honour those diseased and injured in warfare and to support them with loving care.’ He demonstrated the organization’s sense of humanity through Buddhist, Shintoist, and Confucianist concepts.  Sano Tsunetami, however, utilized his lecture tours to frame the Red Cross’s sense of humanity through the lens of nationalism, appealing to the inevitability of war as part of human nature and a desire to protect the nation. Sure enough, the number of recruits increased by almost twentyfold in 1897, two years after the war between China and Japan.                                                                                                    More women received secondary education in the 1910s because of the “good wife, wise mother” ideology that women needed education to raise intellectual children of the Modern Japanese future. Also, more women entered the Japanese workforce post WWI due to price increases from the war economy, socio-economic hardships, and a higher demand from employers who sought the now larger pool of educated women for clerical, teaching, nursing, and other more "feminine" types of work.

Despite China having a numerical and landscape advantage, and the support of Western nations, the country failed to keep their hold on Shanghai. The Battle of Shanghai and the subsequent occupation of Shanghai further divided the two nations apart and foreshadowed the coming of World War II.	The battle between Japan and China illustrated the consequences of a mechanized war. Shanghai became a battlefield holding two vast armies with both holding destructive weapons. Although there had been other instances of modernized warfare before, the aftermath of the Battle of Shanghai produced scenes of flattened housing complexes and gutted factories that horrified the global public. Citizens and stateless people that lived in Shanghai or in areas near the city witnessed the scenes of the carnage up close. Even though the Battle of Shanghai is considered to be separated from the overarching context of World War II, the battle continues to create friction between the two nations today.	Today, many critics debate whether the Battle of Shanghai and the subsequent Japanese occupation of the city was a prologue or the beginning of World War II. Many argue that this event was the first major battle that divided mankind into fascist regimes or democratic and totalitarian nations. For many westerners, the invasion of Poland in 1939 by Adolf Hitler is considered to be the start of World War II, but for the Eastern world, the events in 1937 mark the beginning of World War II. Furthermore, very little of the records left behind and writings today on World War II touch on the events of Shanghai in 1937, leaving a rather gaping hole in historiography.

Its name was changed to the Supreme War Guidance Council on August 5, 1944 and was later abolished following the end of World War II. FOR FOLLOW-UP The Chief of General Staff and other high-ranking officers served as members of this council, which advised the emperor Why was it established only in November when fighting started in July?	The establishment of the Imperial Headquarters was brought about by the abolition of the Wartime Imperial Headquarters Ordinance. The Wartime Imperial Headquarters Ordinance, first promulgated on May 22, 1893, stated that Imperial Headquarters could only be set up in times of war. On November 18, 1937, with the outbreak of full-scale war between China and Japan, the Wartime Imperial Headquarters Ordinance was abolished and the Imperial Headquarters Ordinance was eneacted by military ordinance. This new ordinance would allow Imperial Headquarters to be set up in the event of an emergency. On November 20, 1937, the Imperial Headquarters was established in the Imperial Palace and continued until the end of World War II. Among the most prominent meetings held during that time was the Imperial Conference attended by the emperor.

This was a real meeting that took place on December 7, 1937 as Yamada and other Japanese journalists were attempting to justify their country's imperialistic actions in China, claiming that they fighting a righteous war against communism.	Yamada Waka's feminism took its inspiration from Western notions of "mother's rights." From her pioneering efforts in the 1910s sprouted a Mother-Child Protection Law in 1937 that provided financial aid for households with single mothers and an absent father. She complimented the emerging “good wife, wise mother” ideology among Japanese feminists that women needed education to raise intellectual children of the Modern Japanese future. Thus, the government began to support women’s education because it fostered nationalism among women and encouraged them to instill it into their children. Through this framework, Yamada and other like-minded feminists harnessed nationalist ideology for the betterment of women's lives, which might explain how she as an intellectual could still justify imperialism.

Pacification squads worked to assist residents of occupied territories to prevent hostile actions directed toward military administration, thus promoting a cooperative attitude when military administration was implemented in the designated territories. Japan's pacification efforts were heavily focused in the region of Manchuria. To ensure the success of the occupied territories and the achievements of military objectives, the pacification squads disseminated propaganda through numerous forms of media such as movies, radio, plays, newspapers, and pamphlets. Other methods of pacification included the guarantee of food, clothing, shelter, hygiene, and medical care for the residents. Female groups of local Chinese housewives and daughters were organized to reach out to Chinese families and became good points of contact with residents.

Japanese soldiers faced harsh, frigid conditions while fighting in the northern regions of China, particularly during the winter months. The extreme cold had a profound impact on the troops, severely affecting their operations, health, and morale.  Soldiers had to contend with numerous challenges related to the cold weather, such as keeping warm, maintaining their equipment, and ensuring their weapons functioned properly. Supplies of proper winter clothing and gear were often insufficient, leaving many soldiers vulnerable to the elements. The extreme cold also affected the soldiers' ability to carry out military operations. Troops had to deal with frozen ground, making it difficult to dig trenches and establish defensive positions. Vehicles and other equipment were prone to malfunctioning or breaking down in the low temperatures.

These bags usually contained an imon ningyō, or a hand-made comfort doll, alongside food, clothing, letters, and other items. 	The imon ningyō, or comfort dolls, in particular were a key part of the comfort bag phenomenon because they mimicked a sense of personhood ##[intimacy, personal connection -- reminded the solider of personal connections?]## that attached the recipient to the giver, regardless of whether he received it from a family member or a patriotic stranger. As women were the primary givers, they offered a sense of nostalgia for the female "home" sphere that male soldiers had been removed from while simultaneously instilling a sense of duty and obligation to the empire. Women were encouraged by propoganda in home magazines, home economics teachers, and a variety of media to create these dolls as part of their own responsibility for Japan's victory against the evil West. Such preoccupations allowed Japan to distinguish itself from the violence caused by its own colonial pursuits.	NA

Wang Kemin was a Chinese politician and financier who held various positions in the Beijing government such as Finance General and Governor of the Bank of China. He studied economics in Japan and was widely viewed as a pro-Japanese politician in the North China government. His favorable relationship with Japan is believed to be the reason for his appointment as the leader of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China in Beijing. When the Provisional Government was replaced by Wang Jingwei's Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China, Wang Kemin became Chairman of the North China Political Council. After Japan's surrender in World War II, Wang Kemin was arrested by the government of China and tried for treason. Wang Kemin would die in prison (Possibly suicide.

The two men pictured are Hata Shunroku of the Central China Army and Terauchi Hisaichi of the North China Army.	From April to June 1938, a large scale operation between the Japanese and Chinese armies took place near Xuzhou. The Japanese army had adopted a non-expansion policy in earlier in February 1938. However, due to the proximity to Taieruzhuang, a large contingent of roughly 400,000 soldiers of the Chinese Army were in the vicinity of Xuzhou. In a bid to swiftly stamp out the Chinese forces, the North China Army began its offensive first in mid-April and the Central China Army (Central China Expeditionary Force) began its offensive in early May. The two armies encircled Xuzhou from the north and south. On May 19th, Xuzhou was occupied, but the main forces of the Chinese army slipped through the net of the combined Japanese forces, allowing them to escape and retreat. On June 12th, the Chinese army destroyed the embankment of the Yellow River, causing significant flooding that foiled the Japanese efforts to pursue the retreating Chinese forces.	NA

Volunteer work was particularly enforced among Japan's colonies through an imposed public education system.	Throughout Japan's colonies, elementary school aged students were mobilized into the war effort through a division of labor between masculine construction projects and feminine cleaning and sewing duties. June 1938 saw the implementation of the Task Concerning the Establishment of Labor Duties for Students, the earliest recorded project that Japan instituted for Korean public schools. The empire promoted volunteering as a means of minimal state intervention into citizen-led labor that fostered nationalism on a grassroots level. 	Volunteer efforts would increase tremendously in 1942 as the Japanese government sought to mitigate a labor shortage by formally mobilizing women into war production. The Women's Labor Volunteer Corps, established 1943, called for school-aged Korean girls to spend at least a year devoted to fueling the empire's war industries. While the Corps targeted middle-class girls in principle, it was mostly upheld by lower-income families in need of not only higher wages to support themselves, but an opportunity to acquire social capital through patriotic work. Women's employment ranged from manufacturing and construction work to textile production, though the latter was more common.

The fleet's presence also served to project Japanese power and influence in China during a period of intense imperial rivalry among major world powers.	The Japanese Yangtze Fleet, established during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was a specialized naval detachment deployed along the Yangtze River in China to protect and advance Japanese interests in the area. The fleet, consisting of a mix of warships, gunboats, and support vessels, conducted patrols and provided support to Japanese diplomatic, commercial, and consular activities in the region.  During this period, the Yangtze River was a crucial trade route and a strategic location for international influence in China. As a result, several major powers, including the United States and European nations, maintained their own naval forces along the river. The Japanese Yangtze Fleet's presence signified Japan's growing status as an imperial power and its commitment to asserting its influence in the region.  The fleet played a vital role in several incidents and military actions, including the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).

During this time, waste such as copper, bronze, and brass were salvaged for military production. The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry pushed for waste salvaging not only through Japan but also throughout the Japanese empire.	The Japanese government initiated widespread salvaging of waste to stimulate "spiritual mobilization" throughout the Japanese empire. Many of the salvaging efforts were taken up by local associations which later came into conflict with the professional scrap trade. The Japanese also relied on Korean waste traders due to their specialized expertise and cheap labor cost. This trade with Korean waste traders was however pushed out after a series of discriminatory measures in 1945. In general, those part of the wartime salvage efforts, such as the large scrap wholesalers, provided the foundations for the post war Japanese recycling industry today.	In order to establish the ideological and material purpose of wartime waste salvaging, the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry took Nazi Germany as their prime example. In 1938, Japan implemented a "German" waste system where it monitored, licensed, and identified waste trade. This system would allow Japan to prevent criminal activity, impose prices, and keep production costs as low as possible. Although this waste system was a way to exclude Jewish scrap dealers and benefit "Aryan" Germans for Nazi Germany, the Japanese had no comparable ideological motivations.

This was born from the government's anxiety that the nation would lose interest in supporting the military, resulting in several organizations that brought wounded soldiers into the public sphere and fostered empathy for them.	In these postcards, soldiers were rarely depicted in rough condition because such jarring illustrations could deter the audience at home from supporting the military. Illustrations also favored young girls over young boys, as a young boy standing next to a wounded soldier might frighten families from sending their sons into military service. Nonetheless, boys and girls alike were expected to complete school assignments that instilled appreciation for the Japanese military throughout Home Front Support Strengthening Week.	In February 1934, Japan grew concerned that public interest in the military would wane once financial aid for servicemen fell back to its peacetime levels. As a result, the government created a centalized coordinating committee that oversaw private-sector military support services. One service included the Japanese Red Cross Society for direct patient care, and another, Aikoku Fujinkai, carved out a space for upper middle class women to visit soldiers in military hospitals, inculcating the imperial feminine ideal of a woman who nurtures the wounded for the health of the empire.

The battle took place along the border of Manchuria and Korea and resulted in a Soviet victory. The conflict had a significant impact on the relationship between the two nations and their respective alliances. 	The Battle of Khasan occurred during a period of heightened tension between the Soviet Union and Japan. It started over a disputed section of the border near Lake Khasan in the Far East region of Russia, where both countries had conflicting claims to the territory. The Japanese, seeing the area as being within their sphere of influence, decided to take control of it by force. This led to a military conflict that lasted for several days and involved intense fighting between the two sides. Both the Japanese and Soviet military suffered significant casualties in the battle, but in the end, the Japanese were unable to gain control of the disputed territory and were forced to retreat.

Over one million awards were made over its history with only 41 1st class medals being awarded. It was abolished by Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers of Occupied Japan Douglas MacArthur in 1947. The Order of the Rising Sun is the first national award given by the Japanese government. Established on April 10, 1875, it had nine classes until a change in 2003 moved the bottom two classes to the Order of the Paulownia Flowers. Above the medal, three paulownia flowers are attached to the ribbon. Paulownia flowers are from the Paulownia tree, a popular ornamental tree found in Japan. It is still awarded today and can be given to those who do not live in Japan. In 2020, Bill Gates (Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Co-founder of Microsoft) received this award in the 1st class for contribution to medical technology to Japan and the world due in part to his funding of health initiatives, especially the Coronavirus pandemic.

56	靖國神社	NA	NA	四か二が出れば上り	Yasukuni Shrine	NA	NA	If a 4 or 2 is rolled then proceed	Yasukuni Shrine is a shrine located in Tokyo which is dedicated to the spirits of the 2.4 million people who have died since 1853 in Japan’s various wars. It was founded in 1869 at the initiative of Emperor Meiji in order to venerate all those who had died in the campaigns to reestablish imperial rule.  	Whereas other special shrines established during the Meiji Era enshrined prominent individual historical figures as deities, Yasukuni Shrine honored ordinary soldiers who had died in battle, of battle wounds or battle-related accidents, or in detention by the enemy and eventually those who had lost their lives from war-related illnesses. During World War II, the government used Yasukuni Shrine to promote nationalism and militarism, but after Japan’s defeat in 1945 the government was compelled to terminate all support for the shrine. 	Today, Yasukuni Shrine is discussed in a more political debate rather than religious. Yasukuni Shrine has historically been controversial after the end of World War II as it commemorates not only those who died in battle but also war criminals. Many other countries today such as China, Russia, South Korea, and North Korea have called the Yasukuni Shrine as the typical example of the revisionist ideal that the Japanese right-wing have taken. Rightists consider that Japan’s historical identity is at stake with the Yasukuni Shrine controversy and that Japan’s war atrocities have been exaggerated. By accepting the position of the Japanese left-wing and the countries previously mentioned, Japan would essentially be accepting the fact that Japanese history from the mid 19th century to mid 20th century was a mistake. Therefore, many postwar prime ministers and cabinet ministers have refrained from supporting and making visits to the shrine due to this political dispute coming from both domestic and foreign entities.  
57	バイアス湾上陸	昭和十三年十月十二日上陸	NA	「３」が出れば「上り」	Landing at Bias Bay	Landed on October 12, 1938	NA	Move up/Proceed if a 3 is rolled	In 1938, Japanese forces landed at Bias Bay, located in the Guangdong province of China. The landing was part of Japan's ongoing invasion of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.	The Japanese landing at Bias Bay in 1938 was a strategic operation carried out during the Second Sino-Japanese War, aimed at securing a key supply route for Japan's military operations in southern China. By establishing control over Bias Bay, located in the Guangdong province, Japan could more effectively exert influence and expand its presence in the region. This event demonstrated Japan's tactical approach to warfare and their ability to execute well-coordinated amphibious assaults, which were critical to their advances throughout the conflict with China.	In 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan launched an amphibious assault on Bias Bay, located in China's Guangdong province. The assault involved a combination of naval, air, and ground forces working in unison to quickly capture the area. Upon securing the beachhead, Japanese forces rapidly moved inland, capturing key infrastructure and transportation nodes, which allowed them to maintain supply lines and reinforce their positions. However, even though they took over the strategic area with minimal consequences, this event increase the fraying of Anglo-Japanese relations. The British Government, with their colony of Hong Kong, nearby was particularly shocked. At the time, the Japanese government tried to reassure the British Ambassador that the offensive was aimed at Chiang Kai-Shek, but Britain was wary of what this portended the future and how the assault would cut access to the Hankow railway – an important transportation system that facilitated key commercial interactions throughout China. 
58	関東占領	昭和十三年十月二十三日占領	NA	「２」「６」が出れば「上り」	Canton Occupation	Occupied on October 23, 1938	NA	Move up/Proceed if a 2 or 6 is rolled	The Canton Operation was a military campaign during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938. The Imperial Japanese Army launched an assault on Guangzhou (Canton) with the intention of capturing the city and surrounding areas. The battle lasted for several months, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides, and eventually ended with the Japanese capturing Guangzhou. 	The Canton Operation was a critical turning point in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Japan's goal was to gain control of southern China, and Guangzhou was a major transportation hub and industrial center. The city's fall allowed the Japanese to secure a vital foothold in the region and launch further offensives. The operation involved the coordinated use of ground, air, and naval forces, and its success boosted Japanese morale and confidence. However, the battle was also a significant loss for the Chinese Nationalist government, weakening their position and causing them to retreat further inland	The Canton Operation was a multifaceted conflict that had far-reaching implications for both China and Japan. On the Japanese side, the operation represented a continuation of their strategy to dominate China and secure resources for their expanding empire. The Imperial Japanese Army employed a variety of tactics, including psychological warfare, amphibious assaults, and air raids, to capture Guangzhou and its surrounding areas. For the Chinese Nationalist government, the Canton Operation was a significant defeat that led to a shift in their strategy for the remainder of the war. They recognized the importance of strengthening their military and working more closely with Communist forces to resist Japanese aggression. The Canton Operation also had significant consequences for civilians in the region, who suffered from widespread violence, displacement, and economic disruption. The battle involved the use of chemical weapons by the Japanese, causing lasting health problems for those exposed to them. The Canton Operation is thus a critical event in the history of the Sino-Japanese War, illustrating the complexity and brutality of modern warfare and its impact on civilians
59	漢口陥落	昭和十三年十月二二十七日	NA	NA	The Fall of Hankou	October 27th, Showa 13	NA	NA	The fall of Hankou/Hankow/Wuhan to the Japanese in the Sino-Japanese War was a significant event that marked a major turning point in the conflict. After a long siege, the city finally fell to the Japanese forces, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and widespread destruction	The fall of Hankou/Hankow/Wuhan occurred in 1938 during the Second Sino-Japanese War, a conflict that began in 1937 and lasted until the end of World War II. The Japanese invasion of China was part of a broader imperialist expansionist policy that aimed to establish Japan as the dominant power in Asia. The fall of Hankou was a major victory for the Japanese, as it gave them control over the Yangtze River and allowed them to establish a strong foothold in central China. The battle for Hankou was brutal and lasted for several months, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians. The fall of Hankou had a significant impact on the course of the war, as it weakened the Chinese resistance and paved the way for further Japanese advances	NA
60	長期建設	NA	NA	NA	Long-range Construction	NA	NA	NA	The seemingly ordinary phrase "long-range construction" refers, in this context, to national mobilization plans for war in China. There is thus a tension between the image and the text. While illustration shows three peaceful and happy children (left to right: China, Japan, and Mongolia), the text recognizes that the "China incident" is actually a massive and protracted war. 	Under Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro, the Japanese Diet passed the State General Mobilization Law (国家総動員法, Kokka Sōdōin Hō) in March 1938 and it went into effect in May. The law gave the government enormous power over the economy, including, not only wages and price controls but also  the power to "restrict or prohibit establishment of companies ... [or] changes in purposes of businesses." The phrase "long-range construction" began to appear in the media in July as part of this national mobilization plan.	NA
