千人針	NA	NA	NA	Thousand Person Stitches	NA	NA	NA	A senninbari 千人針 is a long white cloth with 1000 red stitches. Each stitch was commonly done by a different woman, usually by wives and mothers, and were given to Japanese men that were going off to war. Senninbari (literally, stiches from a thousand people) were supposed to protect the wearer against injury and misfortune. The practice began with the 1894-95 Sino-Japanese War, but public campaigns to stitch senninbari surged in 1937.	The senninbari originated from The First Sino-Japanese War where the senninbari was not a long piece of cloth but rather a handkerchief. Red thread was used most as it had a meaning of avoiding disasters, but later on other colors of thread were used. Men would commonly wear the senninbari around their waist and stomach area. In Japan, the stomach represents the area where one’s vitality and power resides, so wearing the senninbari around the stomach was especially significant. Many senninbaris were personalized with different images (such as the rising sun and tigers) and patriotic slogans. Some senninbaris also had coins stitched into it as it was believed that coins could provide more protection. Some also had pockets to hold good luck charms which were purchased from shrines and temples. 	Tigers were a popular motif and were stitched on senninbaris because they were believed to have the power to roam far from home and return safely, which is what people were hoping for on behalf of the soldiers. These motifs of tigers came from the phrase “a tiger travels a thousand miles and returns a thousand miles” (虎は千里を行き千里を帰る). Because of this, it was said that the stitches of women born in the year of the tiger would be more effective, especially if they sewed the number corresponding to their age.

Wartime media commonly depicted women at train stations enthusiastically sending off Japanese soldiers with food. Their departure for war, known as shussei 出征 on the home front, was supposed to be a reason for celebration rather than sorrow among soldiers and families alike. In public, families and friends of soliders often celebrated death in combat as a demonstration of courage and loyalty to the state.	Japanese schoolchildren were condiitioned to learn new vocabulary related to the empire's preparation for war, including shussei, which translates as "departure to the front" or "going to war." Instilling reverence for the military into youth curricula was part of a broader celebration of the military in Japanese imperial culture. Future soldiers were told that they should not fear death, but rather channel their nationalist zeal for the empire into a heroic death for the emperor. This suguroku is part of that celebration of death in battle: see for example square 17	The rhetoric of self sacrifice for the emperor was part of a modern reimagining of samurai culture, reinterpreted for propaganda purposes. Soldiers' diaries reflect the impact of this ideology. Even if soldiers questioned the ideology, they felt compelled to maintain the appearance selfless devotion to the emperor. 
挙国一致	皆手を三度たゝく	NA	皆手を三度たゝく	National Unity	Everyone clap three times	NA	Everyone clap three times	As Prime Minister of Japan, Konoe Fumimaro directed the expansion of the so-called "China Incident" into a full-scale invasion of China. During his first term as Prime Minister from 1937 to 1939, he refused to recognize the Guomindang as the government of Chinese and began dividing China into Japanese client states instead. Ironically, Konoe was chosen as Prime Minister because of his reputation as a level-headed leader, but in 1937-38 he was more belligerent and impulsive than many Japanese generals. Belated in recognizing the consequences of his recklessness, he began arguing for a surrender to the US in 1944. After surrender, the US Occupation briefly considered Konoe an ally, but then deemed him a war criminal. Facing the prospect of arrest, Konoe committed suicide in December 1945.	Konoe Fumimaro's efforts to reduce tensions with the Western powers involved a combination of diplomatic negotiations and policy changes. In 1938, he proposed a peace initiative known as the "Konoe Plan" which aimed to settle the ongoing conflicts in Asia and improve relations with the Western powers. [##obviously didn't work -- what happened##] The plan involved a series of negotiations with the Western powers, including the United States, in an effort to resolve the growing tensions between Japan and the West. Additionally, Konoe implemented a series of domestic policies aimed at moderating Japan's foreign policy and avoiding conflict with the West. He sought to reduce military spending [##again didn't work!!##] and improve relations with the Soviet Union, where in the latter effort, his government signed the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact. He also established a cabinet-level organization, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, to coordinate government policies and promote a more moderate and stable foreign policy.	NA

Lugouqiao, J. Rokōkyō) on July 7th. Local military commanders negotiated a shaky ceasefire, but national leaders escalated the conflict. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe demanded an apology from Chiang Kai-shek for "illegal anti-Japanese actions," and Chiang responded that yielding "one more inch of our territory" to Japan would be an "unpardonable crime against our race." In that heated environment, Chinese troops in army of the Hebei Autonomous Government 冀東防共自治政府 (a buffer state created by Japan) rebelled against Japan and killed Japanese troops and civilians. The Japanese press published long, detailed account of those attacks on Japanese civilians, but omitted news of Japanese crimes against Chinese civilians. Such selective reporting made Japan's invasion of China seem not only just but humane. 	The Tongzhou Incident took place on July 29, 1937, during the Second Sino-Japanese War and marked a turning point in the conflict. Chinese troops who were part of the East Hebei Autonomous Government, a puppet government established by Japan, mutinied against their Japanese advisors and collaborators in Tongzhou, a strategically important city near Beijing. The mutiny resulted in the deaths of several hundred Japanese and Chinese collaborators. The incident had significant consequences, as it fueled anti-Japanese sentiment in China and led to a further escalation of hostilities between China and Japan.	The mutiny was sparked by growing resentment and frustration among the Chinese soldiers, who felt they were being mistreated and exploited by their Japanese superiors. The uprising began in the early hours of the morning and quickly escalated, with the mutineers killing several hundred Japanese soldiers, Chinese collaborators, and their families. The violence continued for several days, with Chinese troops eventually regaining control of the city.The Tongzhou Incident had far-reaching consequences for the course of the Second Sino-Japanese War. It fueled anti-Japanese sentiment among the Chinese population, with many seeing the mutiny as a symbol of Chinese resistance against Japanese aggression. The incident also led to a further escalation of hostilities between China and Japan, as the Japanese military sought to retaliate for the loss of life and humiliation suffered during the mutiny. Ultimately, the Tongzhou Incident played a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the conflict between China and Japan during this period.

Guomindang forces around Beijing fought valiantly for a week, before surrendering to the larger and better equiped Japanese Army. Unlike the subsequent Japanese occupations of Shanghai and Nanjing, the surrender in Beijing was relatively orderly with limited civilain casulaties.  	At 8 am on July 29, the 11th Independent Mixed Brigade of the Kwantung Army attacked Chinese positions near Huangsi and Beiyuan. The Hebei Peace Preservation Corps defending Huangsi withdrew at 6 pm. The 39th Independent Brigade defending Beiyuan was disarmed by the Japanese two days later. Beiping soon fell to the Japanese. General Masakazu Kawabe, commander of the CGA Brigade, entered the city on August 8 in a military parade in which the citizens of Beiping were forced to celebrate.At dawn on July 29, the IJA 5th Division and Japanese marines attacked Tianjin and the port of Tanggu, defended by Chinese units of the 38th Division. The Chinese soldiers and many local volunteers fought gallantly. They even managed to capture the Tianjin Station from the Japanese. The 38th Division mounted a series of counterattacks on the Japanese headquarters at Haiguangsi and the Dongjuzi airport. However, the Japanese were able to repulse the Chinese counterattacks with artillery and air support. After heavy fighting, Tianjin fell to the Japanese on July 30.On July 31, the 27th Independent Brigade managed to break out of Beiping to Chahar and returned to the NRA 143rd Division. That same day, Japanese forces finally conquered the entirety of Beiping-Tianjin by capturing the last Chinese positions near Dahuichang.The Battle of Beiping-Tianjin had ended, but a full-scale war had now erupted between China and Japan.## add something about unresolved issues between Japan and PRC -- has Japan "apologized"	NA

He served as Chiang Kai-shek's air force advisor, leading the war against Japan. With the aid of the U.S. government he created an American Volunteer Air Corps famously known as the Flying Tigers.

The ship spent most of the 1920s as a training ship for naval cadets and became flagship of the JN's China forces in 1932, when Japanese and Chinese clashed in Shanghai. Izumo participated in the Battle of Shanghai five years later and was not damaged, despite repeated aerial attacks.	Kiyoshi Hasegawa was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy and the 18th Governor-General of Taiwan during most of the Pacific War, serving from December 1940 to December 1944. In December 1936, Hasegawa was given command of a fleet, and was appointed commander of the Third Fleet on 20 October 1937. The Panay Incident took place during his tenure as fleet commander. As Commander-in-Chief of the Third Fleet in China, Hasegawa met several Chinese admirals and generals, who respected Hasegawa for his civil behavior. He was once again assigned to command the Yokosuka Naval District on 25 April 1938, and was promoted to full admiral on 1 December 1939.Izumo was the lead ship of her class of armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself, the ship was built in Britain. She often served as a flagship and participated in most of the naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Izumo was ordered to protect Japanese citizens and interests in 1913 during the Mexican Revolution and was still there when World War I began in 1914. She was then tasked to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping off the western coasts of North and Central America. The ship assisted the armored cruiser Asama in early 1915 when she struck a rock off Baja California. In 1917, Izumo became the flagship of the Japanese squadron deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. After the war, she sailed to Great Britain to take control of some ex-German submarines and then escorted them part of the way back to Japan. The ship spent most of the 1920s as a training ship for naval cadets and became flagship of the IJN's China forces in 1932 during the First Shanghai Incident. Izumo participated in the Battle of Shanghai five years later and was not damaged, despite repeated aerial attacks. The ship played a minor role in the Pacific War, supporting Japanese forces during Philippines Campaign until she struck a mine.

A year later, Japan formally implemented its food ration system by donating most of its surplus goods to the military and selling the rest back to local corporations. As a result, civilians felt starvation before soldiers did, even though Japan was not yet part of WWII.	Japan, in need of rations for its military, diverted exports of rice from Korea and Taiwan to their own market, effectively starving these people. This created a vehicle through which the imperial government could promote assimilation by distributing food rations to citizens who participated in cultural practices, such as Shintōism. Furthermore, they stressed self-sufficiency among the colonies despite their own reliance on them to support the military. When Taiwanese and Korean markets suffered a bad harvest in 1939, Japan reoriented its attention to Southeast Asian markets for the remainder of WWII, completely redirecting their rice exports to the mainland. This reveals how the empire, despite having not yet joined the Axis Powers, fully intended to wage total war.	NA

Rolls other than 1, 3, and 5 may not proceed	The Japanese naval blockade in August 1937 was a strategic move during WWII, aimed at isolating and weakening the Chinese government. The blockade effectively cut off China's access to international trade, causing significant economic hardships for the Chinese.	During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese navy implemented a blockade in August 1937 to isolate and undermine the Chinese government. By cutting off China's access to international trade and resources, Japan aimed to weaken China's ability to resist its advances. The blockade had severe economic consequences for the Chinese, as it disrupted the flow of essential goods, such as food, fuel, and military supplies, leading to increased hardships for the Chinese population.	The blockade encompassed a wide area of the Chinese coast, stretching from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the southernmost tip of China. Japanese warships patrolled the waters, intercepting and detaining any foreign vessels attempting to enter Chinese ports. This effectively cut off China's access to vital resources, including food, fuel, and military supplies, which were critical for sustaining its war effort and supporting its population.The economic impact of the blockade was profound, leading to widespread shortages and soaring inflation in China. The Chinese government struggled to maintain its war effort and provide for its people, which further undermined its ability to resist Japanese advances. The blockade also placed significant pressure on the international community to intervene in the conflict, as countries with economic interests in the region were directly affected by the disruption of trade. Ultimately, the Japanese naval blockade in August 1937 played a crucial role in shaping the course of the Second Sino-Japanese War and had far-reaching consequences for China and the global community.

It served as a strategic site for the Japanese Army’s military campaigns during WWII. The Japanese landings in Hangzhou Bay forced many civilians into refugees and foreshadowed the coming of the Nanjing Massacre.	Japan’s capture of Beiping and Tianjin in July 1937 and attack on Shanghai in August 1937 kick-started the invasion of China. In October 1937, the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEA), which was led by Gen. Matsui Iwane, was ordered to destroy enemy forces in and around Shanghai. Gen. Iwane was later joined with Gen. Yanagawa Heisuke who anticipated swift surrender from Chiang Kai-shek’s National Government. However, the Japanese military encountered Chinese resistance, leading to the estimated death of 9,185 and 31,125 wounded Japanese soldiers at Shanghai. With the Japanese landing at Hangzhou Bay, this resistance was snuffed out as the Japanese military successfully gained control of Shanghai.	With the various Japanese military attacks during the second World War, many civilians became displaced. The repeated Japanese landings in Hangzhou Bay caused an estimate of around five million of the Zhejiangese population into refugee life. The Japanese landing in Hangzhou Bay in early November 1937 caused the residents a rude awakening to the reality of the war. Around 400,000 of the Zhejiang population fled in fear. Three years later, the Japanese launched a second round of large-scale armed attacks in the region. The goal was to take control of the greater part of northern Zhejiang that included Ningbo, a key seaport in the coastal area. This set in motion a fresh wave of refugees, reflecting the experiences of refugees from the Hangzhou Bay landing.

愛国機献納	NA	NA	NA	Patriotic Donations of Aircraft	NA	NA	NA	Campaigns to donate aircraft to the Japanese Army began in 1931 and surged in mid-1937 with Japan's escalation of WWII. This tile does not mention a specific example, but mass media were active in such campaign. In July 1937, for example, The Asahi Shinbun newspaper celebrated how its own campaign raised 600,000 yen (approx $180K) from ordinary readers in just a few days. Such planes were commonly known as "patriotic planes" (aikokugō 愛国号).	Between 1931 and 1945, private campaigns raised funds to donate thousands of aircraft to the military. Organizers included civic groups, businesses, and universities. The campaigns were celebrated through public events as well as commemorative postcards and books.

Such acts of support by the imperial house were common until 1938. The media also celebrated their charity works and their interest in education and public welfare.	Use of the phrase "His Most Gracious Majesty's Spirit" (大御心 ōmigokoro) began to change in 1938. Newspaper stories began to describe the emperor as directly involved in state affairs, helping to plan the war, rather than just spiritually supportive of the troops and their families. Historians disagree on whether that change reflects a real change in the emperor's activities, or merely a shift in publicity and propaganda. This sugoroku from December 1938 is slighly behind that trend and still depcits the emperor as removed from wartime planning.  	NA

The Air Defense Law, enacted on April 5, 1935, integrated air defense exercises under the air defense plan established by the district governor, mobilizing all local residents. Training to minimize damage in the event of an air raid was conceived as part of a national mobilization plan. However, such training and Japanese air defenses in general would prove to be ineffective in the face of real raids. 	On the local level, neighborhoods were organized into fire prevention groups of roughly 10 households. These exercises were ultimately futile in the face of real large-scale raids, such as the US firebombing campaigns, but they played a major role in incorporating the people into the wartime structure. Furthermore, in 1927, the Bureau of Resources was established in the cabinet as a mobilization planning agency. The Bureau of Resources was responsible for overseeing the establishment and execution of plans for the control and operation of human and material resources. The aim of the Bureau of Resources was to strengthen the national defense system. Active-duty military personnel in the Army and Navy served as administrative officers.	NA

Japan was afraid of the Soviet Union and the spread of Communism to China, and saw the pact as a way to counter this perceived threat. By joining forces with Germany, Japan also aimed to improve its military capabilities. The pact thus aimed to enhance bilateral relations between Japan and Germany, to present a unified front against the spread of Communism in Asia, and to enhance Japanese military power. However, it is important to note that the relationship between Germany and Japan was unstable, even despite the agreement.	##[Maybe some period examples of enthusiasm or criticism]##. The domestic political climate in Japan during the time of the Anti-Comintern Pact was quite complex. There were a number of different opinions and perspectives on the issue, with some groups being in favor of the pact, and others being opposed to its existence. The government and military favored the pact, believing it would solidify Japan's position as a major world power and help secure its territorial interests, especially in Asia. They saw this as an important step in helping Japan assert itself as a major power. However, there were many wary of the pact, including intellectuals and members of the general public. They worried that aligning with Nazi Germany might harm Japan's reputation and international standing, and were concerned about the impact this might have on Japan's relationships with other countries, particularly the Soviet Union##	NA
白衣の天使	次の人にお茶を飲ませる	NA	次の人にお茶を飲ませる	Angels in White	Serve tea to the next player	NA	Serve tea to the next player	The Japanese Red Cross Society emerged in 1887 under its first president, Sano Tsunetami 佐野常民 (1822-1902). The relief organization grew from another group that he founded in 1877 known as the Hakuaisha 博愛社. With a new pool of educated women emerging from 1910s reform, it is likely that the Society was among many other employers who sought them out for nursing, clerical, and other forms of "feminine" work.	Originally a politician, Sano Tsunetami supported the Japanese government in the Satsuma Rebellion by utilizing his privileged education in Western Learning, which included Western medicine from the Dutch East India Company as well as military science, especially in Western-style ships and guns. He not only incorporated this knowledge to help found a naval base in the Saga domain, but to found the Hakuaisha for wounded soldier relief.	 To gain recruits, Japanese medical officer Ishiguro Tadanori would hold lectures that illustrated the Red Cross purpose: ‘The responsibility of the Red Cross is to honour those diseased and injured in warfare and to support them with loving care.’ He demonstrated the organization’s sense of humanity through Buddhist, Shintoist, and Confucianist concepts. Sano Tsunetami, however, utilized his lecture tours to frame the Red Cross’s sense of humanity through the lens of nationalism, appealing to the inevitability of war as part of human nature and a desire to protect the nation. Sure enough, the number of recruits increased by almost twentyfold in 1897, two years after the war between China and Japan.                                                                                                    More women received secondary education in the 1910s because of the “good wife, wise mother” ideology that women needed education to raise intellectual children of the Modern Japanese future. Also, more women entered the Japanese workforce post WWI due to price increases from the war economy, socio-economic hardships, and a higher demand from employers who sought the now larger pool of educated women for clerical, teaching, nursing, and other more "feminine" types of work.
上海占領	更に一回賽を振って進撃する	昭和十二年十一月十日占領	更に一回賽を振って進撃する	Occupation of Shanghai	Roll again and continue attacking	Occupied November 10, 1937	Roll again and continue attacking	The occupation of Shanghai by the Japanese Empire occurred on November 10, 1937 after a bloody three month battle at Shanghai. Despite China having a numerical and landscape advantage, and the support of Western nations, the country failed to keep their hold on Shanghai. The Battle of Shanghai and the subsequent occupation of Shanghai further divided the two nations apart, and what seemed to be an end of the war was instead another deep step into what would later be known as WWII.	The battle between Japan and China illustrated the consequences of a mechanized war. Shanghai became a battlefield holding two vast armies with both holding destructive weapons. Although there had been other instances of modernized warfare before, the aftermath of the Battle of Shanghai produced scenes of flattened housing complexes and gutted factories that horrified the global public. Citizens and stateless people that lived in Shanghai or in areas near the city witnessed the scenes of the carnage up close. Even though the Battle of Shanghai is considered to be separated from the overarching context of World War II, the battle continues to create friction between the two nations today.	Today, many critics debate whether the Battle of Shanghai and the subsequent Japanese occupation of the city was a prologue or the beginning of World War II. Many argue that this event was the first major battle that divided mankind into fascist regimes or democratic and totalitarian nations. For many westerners, the invasion of Poland in 1939 by Adolf Hitler is considered to be the start of World War II, but for the Eastern world, the events in 1937 mark the beginning of World War II. Furthermore, very little of the records left behind and writings today on World War II touch on the events of Shanghai in 1937, leaving a rather gaping hole in historiography.
大本營設置	昭和十二年十一月二十日設置	NA	NA	Establishment of Imperial Headquarters	Established November 20, 1937	NA	NA	On November 20th, 1937, a coordination body centralized war guidance between the commander-in-chief and government liaison agencies. However, Japan had already been at war for 4 months with little organization. This body consisted of the Chief of General Staff, Chief of the Naval General Staff, Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of War, as well as other cabinet ministers. Its name was changed to the Supreme War Guidance Council on August 5, 1944 and was later abolished following the end of WWII.	The establishment of the Imperial Headquarters was brought about by the abolition of the Wartime Imperial Headquarters Ordinance. The Wartime Imperial Headquarters Ordinance, first promulgated on May 22, 1893, stated that Imperial Headquarters could only be set up in times of war. On November 18, 1937, with the outbreak of full-scale war between China and Japan, the Wartime Imperial Headquarters Ordinance was abolished and the Imperial Headquarters Ordinance was eneacted by military ordinance. This new ordinance would allow Imperial Headquarters to be set up in the event of an emergency. On November 20, 1937, the Imperial Headquarters was established in the Imperial Palace and continued until the end of World War II. Among the most prominent meetings held during that time was the Imperial Conference attended by the emperor. At this conference, decisions were made on supreme/highest (最高) national policies including the opening of war against the United States and Great Britain.	NA

Yamada and other Japanese journalists attempted to justify their country's imperialistic actions in China, claiming that they were fighting a righteous war against communism.	Yamada Waka's feminism took its inspiration from Western notions of "mother's rights." From her pioneering efforts in the 1910s sprouted a Mother-Child Protection Law in 1937 that provided financial aid for households with single mothers and an absent father. She complimented the emerging “good wife, wise mother” ideology among Japanese feminists that women needed education to raise intellectual children of the Modern Japanese future. Thus, the government began to support women’s education because it fostered nationalism among women and encouraged them to instill it into their children. Through this framework, Yamada and other like-minded feminists harnessed nationalist ideology for the betterment of women's lives, which might explain how she as an intellectual could still justify imperialism.

This is a disturbing image, but for what it omits rather than what it shows. The game depicts the Japanese Army’s seizure of Nanjing as a fireworks celebration, without any civilian or military casualties. But the Japanese Army committed murder, rape, and arson on a massive scale for weeks.	Japanese military discipline began to collapse during the occupation of Shanghai and Nanjing. Even sympathetic Japanese observers were alarmed by the army’s behavior. In April 1938 an army psychologist reported that Japanese troops “carouse and act indecently with low-class prostitutes, brandish their swords for no reason and injure people, discharge their pistols, eat and drink without paying [in restaurants], and act in ways so regrettably contrary to the expectations of those back home in Japan. In truth, Shanghai has become the Japanese army’s city of crime and Nanjing can hardly be any better. Truly, this only speaks of the decline of the Japanese army.” While some commanders sought to discipline their troops, many others acted as though Japan was no longer bound by international agreements on war crimes and let their troops terrorize the civilian population. Our goal in this project is not to assess the scope of Japanese attrocities, but to show how private media sanitized the war for domestic consumption.	NA

The newly established Provisional Government of the Republic of China created the pacification squads in order to help achieve their five goals of stability, promotion of Asian culture and morality, defeat of both the Nationalist and Communist parties, and the realization of a friendly alliance between China and Japan. Pacification squads worked to assist residents of occupied territories to prevent hostile actions directed toward military administration, thus promoting a cooperative attitude when military administration was implemented in the designated territories. Japan's pacification efforts were heavily focused in the region of Manchuria. To ensure the success of the occupied territories and the achievements of military objectives, the pacification squads disseminated propaganda through numerous forms of media such as movies, radio, plays, newspapers, and pamphlets. Other methods of pacification included the guarantee of food, clothing, shelter, hygiene, and medical care for the residents.

These bags usually contained an imon ningyō, or a hand-made comfort doll, alongside food, clothing, letters, and other items. Wives, mothers, volunteers, and students alike were mobilized into creating these through pervasive propaganda at home, school, and work.	The imon ningyō, or comfort dolls, in particular were a key part of the comfort bag phenomenon because they mimicked a sense of intimacy that attached the recipient to the giver, regardless of whether he received it from a family member or a patriotic stranger. As women were the primary givers, they offered a sense of nostalgia for the female "home" sphere that male soldiers had been removed from while simultaneously instilling a sense of duty and obligation to the empire. Women were encouraged by propoganda in home magazines, home economics teachers, and a variety of media to create these dolls as part of their own responsibility for Japan's victory against the evil West. Such preoccupations allowed Japan to distinguish itself from the violence caused by its own colonial pursuits.	NA

This provisional government only lasted until March, 1940 when it was replaced by another, larger puppet state known as the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China, thus further increasing Japan's buffer area.	Wang Kemin was a Chinese politician and financier who held various positions in the Beijing government such as Finance General and Governor of the Bank of China. He studied economics in Japan and was widely viewed as a pro-Japanese politician in the North China government. His favorable relationship with Japan is believed to be the reason for his appointment as the leader of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China in Beijing. When the Provisional Government was replaced by Wang Jingwei's Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China, Wang Kemin became Chairman of the North China Political Council. After Japan's surrender in World War II, Wang Kemin was arrested by the government of China and tried for treason. Wang Kemin would die in prison (Possibly suicide.

The two men pictured are Hata Shunroku and Terauchi Hisaichi. Though the conflict resulted in a Japanese victory, the Japanese Army was unable to successfully contain and capture the remaining Chinese forces. This failure prolonged the war as the Chinese forces that evaded capture played a significant role in subsequent battles.	From April to June 1938, a large scale operation between the Japanese and Chinese armies took place near Xuzhou. The Japanese army had adopted a non-expansion policy in earlier in February 1938. However, due to the proximity to Taieruzhuang, a large contingent of roughly 400,000 soldiers of the Chinese Army were in the vicinity of Xuzhou. In a bid to swiftly stamp out the Chinese forces, the North China Army began its offensive first in mid-April and the Central China Army (Central China Expeditionary Force) began its offensive in early May. The two armies encircled Xuzhou from the north and south. On May 19th, Xuzhou was occupied, but the main forces of the Chinese army slipped through the net of the combined Japanese forces, allowing them to escape and retreat.

While it was labeled as volunteer work, there was societal pressure to contribute, especially in the face of labor shortages during the height of WWII. The labor force consisted of lower-income families, women, and students, including elementary school children.	Throughout Japan's colonies, elementary school aged students were mobilized into the war effort through a division of labor between masculine construction projects and feminine cleaning and sewing duties. June 1938 saw the implementation of the Task Concerning the Establishment of Labor Duties for Students, the earliest recorded project that Japan instituted for Korean public schools. The empire promoted volunteering as a means of minimal state intervention into citizen-led labor that fostered nationalism on a grassroots level. 	Volunteer efforts would increase tremendously in 1942 as the Japanese government sought to mitigate a labor shortage by formally mobilizing women into war production. The Women's Labor Volunteer Corps, established 1943, called for school-aged Korean girls to spend at least a year devoted to fueling the empire's war industries. While the Corps targeted middle-class girls in principle, it was mostly upheld by lower-income families in need of not only higher wages to support themselves, but an opportunity to acquire social capital through patriotic work. Women's employment ranged from manufacturing and construction work to textile production, though the latter was more common.

The Yangtze Fleet was a loose assortment of gunboats that the Japanese army deployed in China, starting in the late 19th century and leading into WWII.  Futami - a prominent gunboat  - is emblematic of what these vessels would do: safeguard Japanese citizens, trade, and investments in the region. Importantly, these battleships were often decisive in conflicts such as the Battle of Nanchang and they supported the army's further entrechment into cities such as Hankou (also known as Hankow and Wuhan). 	The Japanese Yangtze Fleet, active during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was a naval detachment assigned to patrol the Yangtze River in China. Comprised of various warships and support vessels, the fleet was tasked with safeguarding Japanese citizens, trade, and investments in the region. The fleet's presence also served to project Japanese power and influence in China during a period of intense imperial rivalry among major world powers.	The Japanese Yangtze Fleet, established during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was a specialized naval detachment deployed along the Yangtze River in China to protect and advance Japanese interests in the area. The fleet, consisting of a mix of warships, gunboats, and support vessels, conducted patrols and provided support to Japanese diplomatic, commercial, and consular activities in the region.During this period, the Yangtze River was a crucial trade route and a strategic location for international influence in China. As a result, several major powers, including the United States and European nations, maintained their own naval forces along the river. The Japanese Yangtze Fleet's presence signified Japan's growing status as an imperial power and its commitment to asserting its influence in the region.The fleet played a vital role in several incidents and military actions, including the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). Throughout these conflicts, the Japanese Yangtze Fleet protected Japanese citizens and assets, maintained open trade routes, and contributed to Japan's larger strategic objectives in China.

To create much of this weaponry and artillery materials, waste - such as salvaged bronze, copper, and brass - was absolutely critical. Because these materials were so vital to accumulate, the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry promoted waste salvaging in Japan and throughout the rest of controlled territories. 	The Japanese government initiated widespread salvaging of waste to stimulate "spiritual mobilization" throughout the Japanese empire. Many of the salvaging efforts were taken up by local associations which later came into conflict with the professional scrap trade. The Japanese also relied on Korean waste traders due to their specialized expertise and cheap labor cost. This trade with Korean waste traders was however pushed out after a series of discriminatory measures in 1945. In general, those part of the wartime salvage efforts, such as the large scrap wholesalers, provided the foundations for the post war Japanese recycling industry today.	In order to establish the ideological and material purpose of wartime waste salvaging, the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry took Nazi Germany as their prime example. In 1938, Japan implemented a "German" waste system where it monitored, licensed, and identified waste trade. This system would allow Japan to prevent criminal activity, impose prices, and keep production costs as low as possible. Although this waste system was a way to exclude Jewish scrap dealers and benefit "Aryan" Germans for Nazi Germany, the Japanese had no comparable ideological motivations.

This image mimics a postcard series produced during "Home Front Support Strengthening Week", started in October of 1938 in aims of promoting public attention and respect towards military casualties. Such effort was born from the government's anxiety the nation would lose interest in supporting the military. 	In these postcards, soldiers were rarely depicted in rough condition because such jarring illustrations could deter the audience at home from supporting the military. Illustrations also favored young girls over young boys, as a young boy standing next to a wounded soldier might frighten families from sending their sons into military service. Nonetheless, boys and girls alike were expected to complete school assignments that instilled appreciation for the Japanese military throughout Home Front Support Strengthening Week.	In February 1934, Japan grew concerned that public interest in the military would wane once financial aid for servicemen fell back to its peacetime levels. As a result, the government created a centalized coordinating committee that oversaw private-sector military support services. One service included the Japanese Red Cross Society for direct patient care, and another, Aikoku Fujinkai, carved out a space for upper middle class women to visit soldiers in military hospitals, inculcating the imperial feminine ideal of a woman who nurtures the wounded for the health of the empire.

張鼓峯事件	49へ戻る	昭和十三年七月三十一日、滿ソ國境に於て日ソ兩軍衝突	49へ戻る	The Battle of Lake Khasan	Return to tile 49	On July 31, 1938, there was a military conflict between Japanese and Soviet armed forces at the Manchuria-Soviet border.	Return to tile 49	The Battle of Khasan was a military conflict fought between the Soviet Union and Japan from July to August, 1938. This conflict took place along the border of Manchuria and Korea and resulted in Soviet victory. It is important to note that the Japanese Army engaged with the Soviets more after this battle, where in 1939, they fought the Batte of Khalkhin Gol against the Red Army. This arouses some confusion about what was the exact plan of the Japanese Army; were they seeking war with the USSR or China? At the time, there were disagrements within the military on what conflicts to pursue. The Battle of Khasan being fought is one example exemplfying those internal disputes.	The Battle of Khasan occurred during a period of heightened tension between the Soviet Union and Japan. It started over a disputed section of the border near Lake Khasan in the Far East region of Russia, where both countries had conflicting claims to the territory. The Japanese, seeing the area as being within their sphere of influence, decided to take control of it by force. This led to a military conflict that lasted for several days and involved intense fighting between the two sides. Both the Japanese and Soviet military suffered significant casualties in the battle, but in the end, the Japanese were unable to gain control of the disputed territory and were forced to retreat. The battle marked one of the first direct conflicts between the two countries, showed the Soviet determination to protect its territorial interests, and escalated tensions between the two nations leading to further confrontations in the future. The battle also highlighted the power of Soviet military technology and tactics, which had a lasting impact on Japanese military strategy	NA

After the Russo-Japanese war, war horses were seen as vital and a horse-breeding bureau was created in 1906. During its use Japan bred more than one million horses. Upon entering the 1930s, most nations either mechanized their cavalry, reduced its size, or dissolved it entirely. However, Japan retained their four cavalry brigades and would integrate them later in the decade. Three brigades were sent to Manchuria between 1936-1937 in the Kwatung Army while the last brigade remained in Japan until their demobilization in 1939-1940. Cargo horses were seldom used because of environmental challenges. When they were used, they appeared in small numbers for use in reconassaince and supply transportation.	NA

The Order of the Golden Kite 金鵄勲章 (left) and the Order of the Rising Sun 旭日章 (right). The medal on the left was exclusively given as a military award for bravery or leadership in battle. The medal on the right is awarded to those who have made significant advancements in the culture, public service, and sciences. Both medals were banned by the US Occupation, but the Order of the Rising Sun 旭日章 was resurrected in the 1960s. It began to be awarded to those who have made exceptional contributions to the promotion of Japan's relations with other countries. For example, Mike Mansfield - the longest U.S. ambassador to Japan - received this award in 1990. Before WWII, the insignia was also awarded for distinguished military service.	The Order of the Golden Kite was first given on February 11, 1890 in celebration of the anniversary of the accession of Legendary emperor Jimmu. According to mythos, Jimmu is the great-great-grandson of the sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami. He is said to have conquered the Yamato region with the aid of a golden kite (a bird), becoming Japan's first emperor. Said bird is depicted at the top of the medal. This medal had seven classes. Over one million awards were made over its history with only 41 1st class medals being awarded. It was abolished by Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers of Occupied Japan Douglas MacArthur in 1947.The Order of the Rising Sun is the first national award given by the Japanese government. Established on April 10, 1875, it had nine classes until a change in 2003 moved the bottom two classes to the Order of the Paulownia Flowers. Above the medal, three paulownia flowers are attached to the ribbon. Paulownia flowers are from the Paulownia tree, a popular ornamental tree found in Japan. It is still awarded today and can be given to those who do not live in Japan. In 2020, Bill Gates (Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Co-founder of Microsoft) received this award in the 1st class for contribution to medical technology to Japan and the world due in part to his funding of health initiatives, especially the Coronavirus pandemic.

The Japanese government established the Tokyo Shokonsha in 1869 for these individuals, where it enshrined those who had died in the 1868 Battle of Toba Fushimi, the First Boshin War, and the Japanese Civil War of 1868-1869. The Ministry of the Military managed the institution, and in 1879, the Japanese government formally institutionalized Tokyo Shokonsha by changing its name to Yasukuni Jinja (Yasukuni Shrine). Today, Yasukuni Shrine is shrouded in controversy due to its enshrinement of war criminals and subsequent prime minister visits.	Yasukuni Shrine dates back to the year 1868, when Japan decided to enshrine those who had died to restore imperial status and had qualified as such since 1853. The Japanese government established the Tokyo Shokonsha in 1869 for these individuals, where it enshrined those who had died in the 1868 Battle of Toba Fushimi, the First Boshin War, and the Japanese Civil War of 1868-1869. The Ministry of the Military managed the institution, and in 1879, the Japanese government formally institutionalized Tokyo Shokonsha by changing its name to Yasukuni Jinja (Yasukuni Shrine).Whereas other special shrines established during the Meiji Era enshrined prominent individual historical figures as deities, Yasukuni Shrine honored ordinary soldiers who had died in battle, of battle wounds or battle-related accidents, or in detention by the enemy and eventually those who had lost their lives from war-related illnesses. During World War II, the government used Yasukuni Shrine to promote nationalism and militarism, but after Japan’s defeat in 1945 the government was compelled to terminate all support for the shrine.	Today, Yasukuni Shrine is discussed in a more political debate rather than religious. Yasukuni Shrine has historically been controversial after the end of World War II as it commemorates not only those who died in battle but also war criminals. Many other countries today such as China, Russia, South Korea, and North Korea have called the Yasukuni Shrine as the typical example of the revisionist ideal that the Japanese right-wing have taken. Rightists consider that Japan’s historical identity is at stake with the Yasukuni Shrine controversy and that Japan’s war atrocities have been exaggerated. By accepting the position of the Japanese left-wing and the countries previously mentioned, Japan would essentially be accepting the fact that Japanese history from the mid 19th century to mid 20th century was a mistake. Therefore, many postwar prime ministers and cabinet ministers have refrained from supporting and making visits to the shrine due to this political dispute coming from both domestic and foreign entities.

This assault involve naval, air, and ground forces. Upon capture of the port, Japanese forces established supply lines that would later assist their further assaults into China. The Japanese Army focused much of its attention on strategic coastal areas, but as the war progressed, captured places like these became increasingly strained in supporting the quagmire that was fighting within interior China. 	The Japanese landing at Bias Bay in 1938 was a strategic operation carried out during the Second Sino-Japanese War, aimed at securing a key supply route for Japan's military operations in southern China. By establishing control over Bias Bay, located in the Guangdong province, Japan could more effectively exert influence and expand its presence in the region. This event demonstrated Japan's tactical approach to warfare and their ability to execute well-coordinated amphibious assaults, which were critical to their advances throughout the conflict with China.	In 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan launched an amphibious assault on Bias Bay, located in China's Guangdong province. The assault involved a combination of naval, air, and ground forces working in unison to quickly capture the area. Upon securing the beachhead, Japanese forces rapidly moved inland, capturing key infrastructure and transportation nodes, which allowed them to maintain supply lines and reinforce their positions. However, even though they took over the strategic area with minimal consequences, this event increase the fraying of Anglo-Japanese relations. The British Government, with their colony of Hong Kong, nearby was particularly shocked. At the time, the Japanese government tried to reassure the British Ambassador that the offensive was aimed at Chiang Kai-Shek, but Britain was wary of what this portended the future and how the assault would cut access to the Hankow railway – an important transportation system that facilitated key commercial interactions throughout China.

The Japanese Army launched an assault on the city with the intention of securing it and important strategic surrounding areas. The particular importance of the city is due to its home base of the Guomindang - the nationalist government ruling large swaths of China. Additionally, it was considered an area of the country where China could communicate its need for support from the rest of the international community. The Japanese aimed to seize such communication attempts with this operation	The Canton Operation was a critical turning point in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Japan's goal was to gain control of southern China, and Guangzhou was a major transportation hub and industrial center. The city's fall allowed the Japanese to secure a vital foothold in the region and launch further offensives. The operation involved the coordinated use of ground, air, and naval forces, and its success boosted Japanese morale and confidence. However, the battle was also a significant loss for the Chinese Nationalist government, weakening their position and causing them to retreat further inland	The Canton Operation was a multifaceted conflict that had far-reaching implications for both China and Japan. On the Japanese side, the operation represented a continuation of their strategy to dominate China and secure resources for their expanding empire. The Imperial Japanese Army employed a variety of tactics, including psychological warfare, amphibious assaults, and air raids, to capture Guangzhou and its surrounding areas. For the Chinese Nationalist government, the Canton Operation was a significant defeat that led to a shift in their strategy for the remainder of the war. They recognized the importance of strengthening their military and working more closely with Communist forces to resist Japanese aggression. The Canton Operation also had significant consequences for civilians in the region, who suffered from widespread violence, displacement, and economic disruption. The battle involved the use of chemical weapons by the Japanese, causing lasting health problems for those exposed to them. The Canton Operation is thus a critical event in the history of the Sino-Japanese War, illustrating the complexity and brutality of modern warfare and its impact on civilians
漢口陥落	昭和十三年十月二二十七日	NA	NA	The Fall of Hankou	October 27th, Showa 13	NA	NA	The fall of Hankou (also known as Hankow and Wuhan) to the Japanese marked a major turning point in the war. After a long siege - one of the most extended in the war - the city fell to the Japanese forces, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and widespread destruction. This was particularly devastating for the Chinese, as the city was considered a major wartime hub of the country after Beijing, Tianjin, Canton, and Shanghai were captured. Despite the jovial and cheering nature of the soldiers depicted, the Japanese forces were extremely strained of resources and exhausted. Yet, still, they continued to press forward. 	The fall of Hankou/Hankow/Wuhan occurred in 1938 during the Second Sino-Japanese War, a conflict that began in 1937 and lasted until the end of World War II. The Japanese invasion of China was part of a broader imperialist expansionist policy that aimed to establish Japan as the dominant power in Asia. The fall of Hankou was a major victory for the Japanese, as it gave them control over the Yangtze River and allowed them to establish a strong foothold in central China. The battle for Hankou was brutal and lasted for several months, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians. The fall of Hankou had a significant impact on the course of the war, as it weakened the Chinese resistance and paved the way for further Japanese advances	NA
長期建設	NA	NA	NA	Long-range Construction	NA	NA	NA	The seemingly ordinary phrase "long-range construction" refers, in this context, to national mobilization plans for war in China. There is thus a tension between the image and the text. While the illustration shows three peaceful and happy children (left to right: China, Japan, and Mongolia), the text recognizes that the "China incident" is actually a massive and protracted war. 	Under Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro, the Japanese Diet passed the State General Mobilization Law (国家総動員法, Kokka Sōdōin Hō) in March 1938 and it went into effect in May. The law gave the government enormous power over the economy, including, not only wages and price controls but also  the power to "restrict or prohibit establishment of companies ... [or] changes in purposes of businesses." The phrase "long-range construction" began to appear in the media in July as part of this national mobilization plan.	NA
